# Text-Analysis
<h4>@2020 All rights reserved</h4>
<strong>The program can open any text file specified by the user, and analyze the frequency of verbal ticks in the text, and out put the result in a chart and present to the user.  </strong>

The program will ask the user what ticks to look for (such as "like", "uh", "um", "you know", etc). 
A user can enter multiple ticks, separated by commas - any spaces entered by the user before or after each tic will be ignored.

The program will output:
<ul>
  <li>the total number of tics found in the text</li>
  <li>the density of tics (proportion of all words in the text that are tics)</li>
  <li>the frequency of each of the verbal tics</li>
  <li>the percentage that each tic represents out of all the total number of tics</li>
</ul>
